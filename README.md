# pima_indians_diabetes_prediction
This code performs a comprehensive analysis of the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset using Python and various machine learning techniques. Here's a breakdown of what each section does:

Importing Libraries: This section imports the necessary libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning tasks.

Loading the Dataset: The load_data function loads the dataset from a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.

Understanding the Data with Descriptive Statistics: This section includes functions to display the top rows of the dataset, its shape, data types, and summary statistics like mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, etc.

Distribution of the Class: This function calculates and prints the count of each class in the dataset.

Correlations Between Attributes: This function computes the correlation matrix between attributes using Pearson correlation coefficient.

Skew of Univariate Distributions: This function calculates and prints the skewness of each attribute's distribution.

Understand Data with Visualization: This section includes functions to visualize the data using histograms, density plots, box and whisker plots, correlation matrix plot, and scatter plot matrix.

Data Pre-processing: This section includes functions for data pre-processing tasks such as rescaling, standardization, and normalization.

Feature Selection for Machine Learning: Functions for feature selection using univariate selection and feature importance estimation using Extra Trees Classifier are defined.

Evaluate the Performance of Machine Learning Algorithms: Functions for splitting the dataset, training machine learning models, performing K-fold cross-validation, calculating area under ROC curve, and generating a classification report are defined.

Choosing the Best Algorithm: Functions to compare the performance of various machine learning algorithms using K-fold cross-validation are defined.

Main Function: The main function acts as an entry point for the script, calling the defined functions in sequence to perform the analysis.

Overall, this code provides a comprehensive analysis pipeline for the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset, including data exploration, visualization, pre-processing, feature selection, model training, evaluation, and comparison. It's a structured approach to understand the dataset and select the best machine learning algorithm for predictive modeling.
